# abs

A tiny Linux command line tool that will display the absolute path of a file (or directory and etc.).

## Usages

Run `abs` followed by the target file, and `abs` will print the full absolute path of the target file.

```bash
$ abs [file]
```

## Screenshots

This should look pretty intuitive.
